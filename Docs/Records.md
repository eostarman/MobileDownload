#  Records

There are 115+ types of records in the MobileDownload file. This includes customers, items, brands, employees, currencies and many more.

Each record has:
1. recNid - the numeric ID for the record (other records refer to this one using its recNid)
2. recKey - the record number ("key") as seen in the UI and on reports (for example, item #100123 may be recNid 12)
3. recName - the name of the record (e.g. shown during a search)
